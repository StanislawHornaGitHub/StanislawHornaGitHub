- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [**Monitor Windows Domain Devices**](https://github.com/StanislawHornaGitHub/MonitorWindowsDomainDevices) project
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [**Bash**](https://github.com/StanislawHornaGitHub/Bash_Projects) and [**Swift**](https://github.com/StanislawHornaGitHub/Swift_Landmarks_Introduction)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with some good tutorials for **Swift code development**
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **PowerShell Automations** or **LAN infrastructures**

## Work experience
I am **certified ICT Technician**, who loves **PowerShell scripts** development.
Developing automation for repetetive tasks is really usefull and pleasant for me.
Sometimes I event can not sleep as I am still thinking about the solution.

I worked for 2+ years for **Ministry of Justice UK** as a Nexthink Administrator building **Nexthink Remote Actions** and automated processes for generating reports based on Nexthink and other tools data.

The most challenging always was bulding scripts to generate reports, where I used **PowerShell Background Jobs and Runspaces** to find the best balance between operation time and the resource consumption.
I am also really keen on to **solve algorithmic problems** to deliver same result without additional resources use.

## Personal time
I am a part-time student of Engineer's degree Information Technology at the Lodz University of Technology.

What is more interesting, IT is also my hobby. I have my pretty complex **HomeLAB**, where I am able to test any ideas which came to my mind.

## My GitHub
I used to have a git only as a version control for PowerShell scripts, but I would like to start with some Open-source projects and build something which may be usefull for other users. 

Unfortunatelly **not every repository can be public** (work & studies stuff), but I though that it would be a good idea to push almost all my programs to have the backup of them and be able to generate the statistics what I was doing since I have started my IT studies.
