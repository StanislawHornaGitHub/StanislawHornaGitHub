## Unlike off-the-shelf solutions, I prefer crafting my own tool. 
Flexibility is key — I can fine-tune them to fit my exact needs. No compromises! 🫡 

### Here’s a glimpse into my visionary mindset:

- **Python** is a sweet spot 🌟 - something between scripting and programming language, 
  that allows fast and easily implement solutions which are needed, 
  like developing Prometheus Exporters, which I have created to monitor my own infrastructure.
  
  Oh, and that bar chart you see below? Yep, [Python magic](https://github.com/StanislawHornaGitHub/GitHub_Statistics) 🐍 along with GitHub Actions.

- **PowerShell** 🤓 I started developing all kinds of scripts and automations using it. 
  A huge improvement over Bash or Windows command line, because it is based on objects, 
  not only the text, so more complicated administration tasks can be done easier and faster. 😉

- **Docker** 🔝 It's like a Swiss army knife for internal services, 
  I use it in my [HomeLab](https://github.com/HornaHomeLab) environment for almost everything. 
  Hassle-free re-implementation or migration to different host machines, 
  even software updates that are as easy as re-creating the container with a new image 🖥 💻

- **Bash Apprentice:** 👨‍🎓 I embarked on a journey to learn Bash to supercharge my automation skills on macOS and Linux as well as make a use of it in GitHub Actions. 🐧

## About me
I am a **certified ICT Technician** 🎓 with a strong passion for developing scripts and micro-services
that streamline my daily tasks and enhance my HomeLab. 
Before diving into coding, I started out as a **System Administrator**, where I thrived on implementing ready-to-use monitoring solutions,
to keep an eye on performance and ensure everything was running smoothly.

Today, I focus on improving **Observability** by building custom projects, 
and I’ve also discovered the power of Centralized **Logging and Traces**. 
These tools not only help me track the behavior of my code, but also speed up the process of identifying and fixing bugs.


## [HornaHomeLab](https://github.com/HornaHomeLab)
Beyond my professional work and passion for code,
I manage a **HomeLab** that mirrors the infrastructure of medium-sized enterprises. 
This lab allows me to experiment with and refine advanced solutions, 
showcasing my skills in maintaining and improving complex systems.

To ensure that my infrastructure is scalable, maintainable, and easy to upgrade, 
I created a GitHub organization where I implement **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** principles. 
Through this setup, I leverage **GitHub Actions** for automated **CI/CD** pipelines, streamlining development and deployment processes.
