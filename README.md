## Unlike off-the-shelf solutions, I prefer crafting my own tool. 
Flexibility is key — I can fine-tune them to fit my exact needs. No compromises! 🫡 

### Here’s a glimpse into my visionary mindset:

- **Python** is a sweet spot 🌟 - something between scripting and programming language, 
  which allows me to easily and fast implement solutions which are needed anything it is, 
  like developing Prometheus Exporters, which I have created to monitor my own infrastructure.
  
  Oh, and that bar chart you see below? Yep, [Python magic](https://github.com/StanislawHornaGitHub/GitHub_Statistics) 🐍 along with GitHub Actions.

- **PowerShell** 🤓 I started developing all kinds of scripts and automations using it. 
  A huge improvement over Bash or Windows command line because it is based on objects, 
  not only the text, so more complicated administration tasks can be done easier and faster. 😉

- **Docker** 🔝 It's like a Swiss army knife for internal services, 
  I use it in my [HomeLab](https://github.com/HornaHomeLab) environment for almost everything. 
  Hassle-free re-implementation or migration to different host machines, 
  even software updates that are as easy as re-creating the container with a new image 🖥 💻

- **Bash Apprentice:** 👨‍🎓 I embarked on a journey to learn Bash to supercharge my automation skills on macOS and Linux as well as make a use of it in GitHub Actions. 🐧

## About me
I am **certified ICT Technician** 🎓 with a passion for developing scripts and programs,
that make daily tasks more efficient and enjoyable. 
I find great pleasure in automating repetitive tasks - it's not just a job, 
but a hobby that I love to indulge in my free time. ⏰

However, the world of ideas is vast 🌌 and time is finite. 
Balancing part-time IT studies with full-time work often leaves me with more ideas than time to implement them. 😐
Nevertheless that does not deter me. In fact, it motivates me to do even more. 🔥
Sometimes, I find myself awake at night, engrossed in finding the perfect solution. 🌙

In addition to my professional endeavors and passion for code development, 
I also manage a sophisticated HomeLAB. 🏠
It features customized solutions that are typically found in medium-sized companies, 🏬 
showcasing my ability to maintain and innovate complex systems. 🎛️


## [HornaHomeLab](https://github.com/HornaHomeLab)

To keep Infrastructure as a code which is easy to maintain and upgrade, 
I have created a **GitHub organization** to leverage GitHub Actions to CI/CD processes.


## Work experience

I have joined **Relativity** as Site Reliability Engineer,
in order to combine operational and engineering knowledge with the necessary creativity to develop new solutions,
to address emergency challenges and optimization of existing systems and processes.

As Operation Specialist at the **Bosch** I developed PowerShell automation scripts to streamline daily tasks. 
Scripts were typically integrated with the alerting system,
to ensured timely notifications to the operations team about identified issues.

In my role as a Technical Engineer at the **Atos** I was dedicated for **Ministry of Justice UK** for two years, 
I specialized in Nexthink administration and developing PowerShell scripts as Nexthink Remote Actions. 
My expertise also extends to automating the creation of Nexthink and other tools data-driven reports, 
leveraging PowerShell to collect information from end-points and process it.
