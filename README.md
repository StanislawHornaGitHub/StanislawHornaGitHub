## I’m a tech enthusiast with a penchant for juggling multiple ideas at once. 
My brain is a bustling marketplace of concepts, and I’m constantly exploring new technologies. 

### Here’s a glimpse into my visionary mindset:

- **PowerShell Aficionado:** 🤓 My comfort zone lies in PowerShell. 
It’s my base scripting language, and I wield it with confidence. 😉

- **Python Pathfinder:** 🌟 Python is my trusty sidekick. Armed with Python scripts, 
I calculate investment refunds, [dissect investment funds](https://github.com/StanislawHornaGitHub/Investment_fund_Analyzer), and make informed choices. 
Oh, and that bar chart you see below? Yep, [Python magic!](https://github.com/StanislawHornaGitHub/GitHub_Statistics) 🐍

- **Bash Apprentice:** 👨‍🎓 Recently, I embarked on a journey to master Bash. Why? 
To supercharge my automation skills on macOS and Linux. 🐧

- **Docker Explorer:** 🚶‍♂️ Docker caught my attention during my tech expeditions. 
It’s like a Swiss Army knife for handling internal services. I’ve tinkered with it, 
envisioning seamless re-implementation or migration to different host machines. 🖥 💻

- **Crafting My Solutions:** 🎨 Unlike off-the-shelf solutions, I prefer [crafting my own tools](https://github.com/StanislawHornaGitHub/MonitorWindowsDomainDevices). 
Flexibility is key—I can fine-tune them to fit my exact needs. No compromises! 🫡

## About me
I am **certified ICT Technician** 🎓 with a passion for developing scripts and programs,
that make daily tasks more efficient and enjoyable. 
I find great pleasure in automating repetitive tasks - it's not just a job, 
but a hobby that I love to indulge in my free time. ⏰

However, the world of ideas is vast 🌌 and time is finite. 
Balancing part-time IT studies with full-time work often leaves me with more ideas than time to implement them. 😐
Nevertheless that does not deter me. In fact, it motivates me to do even more. 🔥
Sometimes, I find myself awake at night, engrossed in finding the perfect solution. 🌙

In addition to my professional endeavors and passion for code development, 
I also manage a sophisticated HomeLAB. 🏠
It features customized solutions that are typically found in medium-sized companies, 🏬 
showcasing my ability to maintain and innovate complex systems. 🎛️

## Work experience

I have recently joined **Relativity** as Site Reliability Engineer,
in order to combine operational and engineering knowledge with the necessary creativity to develop new solutions,
to address emergency challenges and optimization of existing systems and processes.

As Operation Specialist at the **Bosch** I developed PowerShell automation scripts to streamline daily tasks. 
Scripts were typically integrated with the alerting system,
to ensured timely notifications to the operations team about identified issues.

In my role as a Technical Engineer at the **Atos** I was dedicated for **Ministry of Justice UK** for over two years, 
I specialized in Nexthink administration and developing PowerShell scripts as Nexthink Remote Actions. 
My expertise also extends to automating the creation of Nexthink and other tools data-driven reports, 
leveraging PowerShell to collect information from end-points and process it.
The greatest challenge was to find the best balance between processing time and the resource consumption.
